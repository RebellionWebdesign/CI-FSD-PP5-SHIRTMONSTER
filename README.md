## OVERVIEW

Shirtmonster is an educational eCommerce website where customers can buy apparel products like t-shirts and hoodies. It was created as the 5th portfolio project for the full stack developer course at [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/). The website can be visited [here](https://shirtmonster-c4453ded83e7.herokuapp.com).

## UX

### Target Audience

The website is geared towards young and stylish people who like to wear printed shirts. This is emphasized by using images of young and "unusual" looking persons wearing the websitesÂ´ products. Also the team image was made with the intention to show users that the website staff is made of people who look the same they do. This gives a sense of customers and staff belonging together and helps the customer to sympathize with the staff.

## Business Model

he business model is B2C (Business to Customer), this means the business sells to customers only. It is possible for musicians and other persons to write an inquiry for a custom shirt, but these are not offered in large quantities.

### The Customer Persona

The website is aimed at a diverse group of persons. May it be young people to adults which have a taste for printed apparel. The customers age might be between 18 to 45 years. The shops emphasis lies in a stylish, dark and modern design providing users the options they need to purchase something quick and easily.

## Web Marketing

### Newsletters

Newsletters are handled via [Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/), there is a newsletter sign-up form appearing at the bottom of the page when the user scrolls down.

<details>
  <summary>Mailchimp Signup</summary>
<img src="docs/readme-files/mailchimp-working.png" ><br>
</details>
To be consize with the german market and its customers, newsletters are only sent when real news are available. For the purpose of this MVP and the limitations of the free Mailchimp plan newsletters wont be sent. Mailchimp free only allows to send newsletters immediately. There is no automation available.

### Facebook

For more presence in the internet and for access to a wide and diverse audience via targeting ads, a facebook page could be made. The mockup page below shows how it could look, according to the old facebook design.

<details>
  <summary>Facebook Mockup</summary>
<img src="docs/readme-files/shirtmonster-fb-mockup.png" ><br>
</details>
In any case there are more possibilities like X/Twitter, Instagram, TikTok and others to widen the audience even more and get more targeted ads out.

### Meta Tags

For good SEO results, meta tags were used. The process for finding the correct and important meta tags is as follows:

- Find initial keywords to use (streetwear, print on demand, t-shirt, shirt, hoodie, print, pod, fashion, apparel)
- Go to [wordtracker.com](https://wordtracker.com)
- Select keywords from initial list (max 2 -> streetwear, print on demand)
- Select highest ranking keywords from list 1 -> **streetwear**, streetwear brands, japanese streetwear, anime streetwear, streetwear hoodies
- Select highest ranking keywords from list 2 -> **print on demand companies**, print on demand shirts, best print on demand sites
- Insert merged list to header meta tag -> (t-shirt, shirt, hoodie, print, pod, fashion, apparel, print on demand, print on demand companies, print on demand shirts, best print on demand sites, streetwear, streetwear brands, japanese streetwear, anime streetwear, streetwear hoodies)

## Future Development

### Finish the admin frontend

As stated in the kanban board, the functionalities for order overviews on the admin side are implemented in the admin backend. However, this feature should be converted to an asy to use frontend for the shop owner.

### Give users the ability to delete their accounts

Users need to be able to delete their accounts. Cheesy tactics like having to contact the business for accout deletion is not possible in germany due to GDPR.

### Order Cancellation

Users need the ability to at least contact the business to cancel an order. Why no button? To ensure the users do not juggle around with their orders.

Django 3.2 also does not provide the tel field.<br />https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/tel |



## Design

### Color Scheme

The chosen color theme is compiled of dark backgrounds and colorful elements to give an underground feel to the site. The colors have a good contrast on dark backgrounds and add visual dynamics to the site by using hover effects and gradient backgrounds to visual landmarks.

## Agile Methodology

### GitHub Project Management

For project management GitHub Projects was used. You can see the roadmap and the kanban board [here](https://github.com/users/RebellionWebdesign/projects/6).

<details>
  <summary>Kanban while working</summary>
<img src="docs/readme-files/agile-board.png" ><br>
</details>

## Flowcharts

To show the websites structure I created a sitemap:

<details>
  <summary>Site structure</summary>
<img src="docs/readme-files/shirtmonster-structure.png" ><br>
</details>
## Information Architecture

The app structure is defined by the database tables and their relationships. The following images illustrate the inital and the final database schema. The following database models are custom models:

- CustomShirt
- WishList
- Testimonials

Other models are from the walkthrough, but modified.

## COMPATIBILITY

For cross-browser compatibility the browsers Google Chrome and Firefox Developer Edition were tested. Apple devices were omitted because I donÂ´t own any. The tests were conducted on the deployed site. For the sake of readbility and to not overwhelm readers I will include representative screenshots from the landing page, forms and the cart. All other screenshots are in the repository if the reader wishes to view them beyond assessment testing.

## BUGS

- A very bad bug which I can not solve for now is that the update_total() function from the walkthrough works only in the cart. I could not pinpoint why the function returns NULL for the related fields on save. This needs to be fixed in the future.

## COMPATIBILITY

For cross-browser compatibility the browsers Google Chrome and Firefox Developer Edition were tested. Apple devices were omitted because I donÂ´t own any. The tests were conducted on the deployed site. For the sake of readbility and to not overwhelm readers I will include representative screenshots from the landing page, forms and the cart. All other screenshots are in the repository if the reader wishes to view them beyond assessment testing.

## AUTOMATIC TESTING

For this MVP there were no automatic tests done.

## MANUAL TESTING

NOTE: Most of the features are available to guests as well as registered users. If a feature is only for registered users it is filed under the related category, if a feature is for all users it will be filed as a guest test.

***NOTE: The following screenshots contain errors either produced by django itself or by libraries like django-countries. These are not fixable for me, because I would need to change the package code which will most likely be overwritten by a future aupdate which may occur. The viable option would be to provide valid html to the developers github repository via pull request.***

## BUGS

- ~~A very bad bug which I can not solve for now is that the update_total() function from the walkthrough works only in the cart. The function is returning NULL on save and reverts back to its default value of 0. I could not find out why this is happening. You can reproduce this by deleting the `default=0` attribute from the Order model and trying to save an order. The error will show the issue. However, this needs to be fixed urgently.~~
  - **This issue was fixed by changing the `self.save()` method to `super().save()` and adding the tax field to the database. Upon order completion all relevant data is saved to the database and gets displayed in the checkout success summary.**

- A smaller bug is that the filter links arent colored when they are clicked. This is happening because the main.js function handling the coloring is an if/else block checking the URL. This can be solved by adding a different visual marker. Due to time constraints this couldnt be implemented.
